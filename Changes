Revision history for Perl extension InfoSys::FreeDB.

0.91 Tue Dec 16 22:24:30 CET 2003
    - Thanks to David Byers for reporting most of these bugs.
    - Chose a version number that is string-wise higher than 0.9.
    - Corrected description in REDME file.
    - Fixed discid format bug in InfoSys::FreeDB::Entry::mk_discid().
    - Let InfoSys::FreeDB::Response::* classes report non-supported
      codes returned by CDDB commands.
    - Minor bug in InfoSys::FreeDB::Connection::CDDBP.
    - Added support for code 210 on query in InfoSys::FreeDB::Connection.
    - Added support for code 211 on read in InfoSys::FreeDB::Connection.
    - For InfoSys::FreeDB::Connection::HTTP automatic maximal protocol
      level detection is switched off for freedb_host "freedb.freedb.org"
      because:.
      1) HTTP is not connection oriented
      2) "freedb.freedb.org" selects a random freedb server for each
         request.
      3) During software upgrade different servers may support different
         maximal protocol levels which may lead to errors.

0.9 Sun Oct  5 21:38:04 CEST 2003
    - First release

Prior to version 0.9 there was Net::FreeDB2 0.8.2.6. All experience
gained from that project is put in this one. The structure is copied
almost 1 to 1 and a large part of the coding is restyled and reused.
